Social Network Analysis aims to measure relationships and information flows between people, groups, organizations, computers and other entities that process information and knowledge. Network nodes are people or groups, and the links are represented by relationships or flows of information that are established or circulating between them.

The study of network diffusion tries to capture the underlying mechanism of this phenomena, whether the subject of interest is a virus spreading through some population, the spreading of a social movement, a fashion trend or innovation, or a marketing message that spreads across an online social network.

Using Python, I have mapped a Social Network example and simulated the independent cascade model.
